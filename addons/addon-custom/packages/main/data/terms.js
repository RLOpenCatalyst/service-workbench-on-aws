    <h4>
      These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement made between
      you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity ("you", "your") and
      {ORGANIZATION} ("University", "we", "our"), concerning your access to and use
      of Service Workbench. You agree to access and use Service Workbench for lawful
      purposes only. By accessing Service Workbench, you expressly consent to the
      monitoring of your actions, content, data transiting and storage therein
    </h4>
    <h4>By accessing and using Service Workbench, you agree that you must:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Conduct only authorized business on the system.</li>
      <li>
        Maintain the confidentiality of your authentication credentials such as your
        password. Do not reveal your authentication credentials to anyone; an
        University employee should never ask you to reveal them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Follow proper logon/logoff procedures. You must manually logon to your
        session; do not store your password locally on your system or utilize any
        automated logon capabilities. You must promptly log off when session access
        is no longer needed. If a logoff function is unavailable, you must close
        your browser. Never leave your computer unattended while logged into the
        system.

        Access Service Workbench using only your own individual account. Group or
        shared accounts are NOT permitted. The credentials used for authenticating
        to Service Workbench must belong to a single individual. Your level of
        access to systems and networks owned by the University is limited to ensure
        your access is no more than necessary to perform your legitimate tasks or
        assigned duties. If you believe you are being granted access that you should
        not have, you must immediately notify
        <a href="mailto:{CONTACT}" target="_blank">{CONTACT}</a>.
